# 🌉 Cross-Chain Yield-Gated TWAP with HTLC Bridge

## ETHGlobal UNITE Hackathon Submission

**The most advanced DeFi arbitrage system with trustless atomic cross-chain swaps**

🏆 **Target Prizes:** 1inch Protocol Prize ($5,000) + Etherlink Prize ($5,000)

## 🚀 Project Overview

A **breakthrough cross-chain yield arbitrage system** that combines sophisticated TWAP strategies with trustless atomic cross-chain swaps using Hash-Time-Lock Contracts (HTLC), enabling secure yield optimization across multiple blockchains without counterparty risk.

### 🌟 Core Innovations
- **🌉 HTLC Bridge**: First trustless atomic cross-chain swaps in competition
- **⚡ Real-Time Yield Detection**: Dynamic market analysis with trend detection
- **🧠 Advanced Arbitrage Logic**: Sophisticated risk scoring (0-100) with comprehensive cost analysis
- **🔗 Enterprise 1inch Integration**: Production-grade API integration with live execution
- **📊 Yield-Gated Execution**: Only execute when yield opportunities exceed thresholds
- **🛡️ Cryptographic Security**: SHA-256 hash locks with time-lock protection
